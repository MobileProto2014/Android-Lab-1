Andorid-Lab-1
=============

Basic UI Elements, ListViews, ListAdapters ... 
In this lab, we will be exploring the basic UI elements (ImageView, TextView, Button) incorporated in a ListView. ListViews are views that handle displaying multiple items of the same layout.  A single item's layout is composed of smaller basic UI elements. ListAdapters hold the data for each item and feeds the content to the ListView. Checkout [ListViews](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html) and [ArrayAdapters](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html). 

### ChatBox!
For the purpose of this lab, you simply need to implement a ListView that dynamically updates based on user input. The example we will use is a simply chatbox; however, you are not limited to implementing a similar application.
